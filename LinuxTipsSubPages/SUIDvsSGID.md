# SUID vs SGID

The difference between `u=s` (Set User ID) and `g=s` (Set Group ID) pertains to how these special permissions affect the execution of files in Linux:

## Set User ID (SUID - `u=s`)

- **Functionality**: When a file has the SUID bit set, it allows users to execute the file with the permissions of the file's owner, rather than the permissions of the user executing the file. This means that if a binary is owned by root and has the SUID bit set, any user executing that binary will run it with root privileges.
- **Use Case**: This is commonly used for programs that require elevated privileges to perform specific tasks, such as changing a user's password or accessing restricted files. For example, the `passwd` command uses SUID to allow regular users to change their passwords without giving them direct access to modify system files.

## Set Group ID (SGID - `g=s`)

- **Functionality**: When a file has the SGID bit set, it allows users to execute the file with the permissions of the group that owns the file. This means that if a binary is owned by a group and has the SGID bit set, any user executing that binary will run it with group privileges.
- **Use Case**: SGID is particularly useful for shared directories where files created within that directory inherit the group ownership of the directory rather than that of the user creating them. This facilitates collaboration among users in a group by ensuring that all files in a shared directory belong to the same group.

### Summary

- **SUID (`u=s`)**: Executes a file with the owner's permissions (often root), allowing elevated privileges.
- **SGID (`g=s`)**: Executes a file with the group's permissions, allowing group-level access and collaboration.

Both SUID and SGID are crucial for managing permissions effectively in a multi-user environment, but they also pose security risks if not managed properly, as they can be exploited if vulnerabilities exist in the binaries they modify[1][2][3].
