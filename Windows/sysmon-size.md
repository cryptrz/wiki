Here's a step-by-step approach to reduce the size:

---

### Step 1: **Check what's taking space**

1. Open `File Explorer` and go to `C:\Sysmon`.
    
2. Sort by file size or date.
    
3. See if there are large `.evtx`, `.log`, or `.xml` files.

### Step 2: **Delete or archive old logs**

If logs are no longer needed, you can:

- **Manually delete** old files.
    
- **Archive** them to a different drive or compress them using `.zip`.
    

_You can also script this cleanup with PowerShell if itâ€™s recurring._

### Step 3: **Adjust Sysmon logging settings**

Sysmon logs to the **Windows Event Log**, but some setups redirect logs to files in `C:\Sysmon`.

- Check your Sysmon configuration file (e.g., `Sysmon.xml`) for verbose logging.
    
- Use a more **minimal configuration** to reduce the amount of data being logged.
    

For example, use [SwiftOnSecurity's Sysmon config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config) as a well-tuned baseline.

To update your config:

```bash
Sysmon64.exe -c sysmon.xml
```

---

### Step 4: **Disable or uninstall Sysmon (if no longer needed)**

If Sysmon is no longer required:

```bash
Sysmon64.exe -u
```

If you just want to stop it temporarily:

```bash
sc stop sysmon
```

---

### Optional: **Automate log rotation**

Use tools like:

- **Logrotate for Windows**
    
- **PowerShell scripts + Task Scheduler**
    

This helps avoid the `C:\Sysmon` folder growing too large in the future.
