**Notes and Troubleshooting:**

- Brightness Controller works by adjusting color profiles using `xrandr`, so it may not function under Wayland sessions or with some hardware configurations:

- For systems where Brightness Controller does not work, alternatives like `brightnessctl` or `light` are available in Fedoraâ€™s repositories and can be installed with `sudo dnf install brightnessctl` or `sudo dnf install light`:
