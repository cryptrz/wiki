# Modes

- AM: Amplitude Modulation
- FM: Frequency Modulation
- NFM: Narrowband Modulation
- WFM: Wideband Modulation

**AM**: Amplitude modulation of the carrier to transmit the signal. It is more sensitive to noise and offers lower sound quality, but allows transmission over longer distances. Its bandwidth is narrower than that of FM.

**FM**: Modulates the carrier frequency. It is less sensitive to noise and offers better sound quality. It can be subdivided into NFM and WFM, depending on the bandwidth used.

**NFM**: Narrow-band FM with a bandwidth typically around 12.5 to 25 kHz. It is used for voice communications such as walkie-talkies or baby monitors, and is therefore unsecured. It does, however, allow more channels to be used on the same frequency band. Sound quality is lower than WFM, but suitable for voice.

**WFM**: Is broadband FM, with a bandwidth around 180 to 250kHz (music, public radio) and has better sound quality with stereo and additional services.
